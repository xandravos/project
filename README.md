# Project CO2
Name: Xandra Vos

### Summary
I want to visualize the investments countries make in different kinds of sustainable energy. It should be easy to understand and a complete summary of the techniques.

### Problem statement
People always think they know what countries invest in what sustainable energy, but I think it is almost never summarized in one visualization. 

### Solution
I want to make a visualization of a world map which gives insight in the investments countries make in sustainble energy.

#### Features

##### MVP
* A world map 
* The amount of money a country invests in sustainable energy per year
* What techniques the money is invested in
* The option to hover over te countries to see information pop up
* The option to chose one technique to see in the world map
* The option to see graphs to represent the growth over the years

##### Optional
* A globe 
* The GDP of the country
* What the potentials of the country would be in terms of sustainable energy

### Prerequisites

#### Data sources
One of the websites I will probably use is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewables).

#### External components
I will probably need to use D3 for the world map.

#### Similar
We got links to some old projects. I think mine will be a bit like [this one](https://fietsboekstoel.github.io/Project/).
In these visualisations, the ecological footprint is expressed as resource use/footprint compared to the resource capacity/biocapacity of the earth, resulting in a reserve or deficit of resources.  I think I would like to make it look a bit more dynamic and I would like to make a globe if possible. Also, I want to do less text to make it more readable and understandable.

#### Hardest parts
I think making the globe will be really hard. Also I think getting data of all the countries will be hard, so I will have to skip some countries maybe. Preparing the data will cost a lot of time.
