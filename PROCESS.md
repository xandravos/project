## day 1 (9/1)
I decided to use Bootstrap to make it easier to make 2 visualizations next to
each other. It also makes it easier to make a navbar.

## day 2 (10/1)
I was ill, so I didn't do anything.

## day 3 (11/1)
I was still ill, but I managed to make the navbar work. Also I started parsing
the data. I used pandas for this, because I wanted to make nested dictionaries
and I used pandas before.

## day 4 (14/1)
The data is in JSON format. Now the worldmap should be made. I didn't manage
to make it. Trying another type.

## day 5 (15/1)
Made the style guide. Still no worldmap. Tried one, but nothing appears. I will
ask for help tomorrow.

## day 6 (16/1)
